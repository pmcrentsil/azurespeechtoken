# rate_limit_manager.py

# Description:
# This file implements a rate limit optimization framework that manages incoming requests
# based on system load. It adjusts rate limits dynamically to ensure that the system can 
# handle large volumes of concurrent requests without exceeding resource limits. The system 
# can throttle requests when necessary to avoid overloading the infrastructure, making it 
# well-suited for high-demand environments like Charter's call centers.

class RateLimitManager:
    def __init__(self, max_connections):
        self.max_connections = max_connections
        self.current_connections = 0

    def can_process_request(self):
        """Determine whether the request can be processed based on the current load."""
        if self.current_connections >= self.max_connections:
            return False  # Rate limit exceeded
        self.current_connections += 1
        return True  # Request can proceed

    def release_connection(self):
        """Release a connection once the request is processed."""
        self.current_connections -= 1

# Example usage:
rate_limit_manager = RateLimitManager(max_connections=10000)
if rate_limit_manager.can_process_request():
    print("Request is being processed.")
    # Process the request
    rate_limit_manager.release_connection()
