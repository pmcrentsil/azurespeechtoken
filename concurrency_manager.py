# concurrency_manager.py

# Description:
# This file provides a solution for managing high concurrency by using a semaphore
# to control the number of concurrent requests being processed at any given time.
# It ensures that the system can scale in real-time and handle a large number of simultaneous
# connections. The scaling solution was designed with environments like Charterâ€™s call centers 
# in mind, where many agents interact with the system concurrently.

    def __init__(self, max_concurrent_requests):
        self.semaphore = threading.Semaphore(max_concurrent_requests)
    
    def can_process_request(self):
        """Check if the system can handle a new request based on current concurrency."""
        return self.semaphore.acquire(blocking=False)
    
    def release_request(self):
        """Release the semaphore after a request is processed."""
        self.semaphore.release()

concurrency_manager = ConcurrencyManager(max_concurrent_requests=1000)

    print("Request is being processed.")
    # Process the request
    concurrency_manager.release_request()
