# performance_tester.py

# Description:
# This file provides performance testing tools to simulate high-load scenarios 
# and assess how the system handles multiple concurrent requests. It helps to 
# ensure that the system can scale efficiently without degradation, which is critical 
# for high-concurrency environments like Charterâ€™s.
